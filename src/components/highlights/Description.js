          We're lonely, we're romantic and the cider's laced with acid and the
          Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef?". And the moon is swimming
          naked and the summer night is fragrant with a mighty expectation of
          relief. So we struggle and we stagger down the snakes and up the
          ladders to the tower where the blessed hours chime. And I swear it
          happened just like this: a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss the Gates of
          Love they budged an inch I can't say much has happened since but
          CLOSING TIME.
